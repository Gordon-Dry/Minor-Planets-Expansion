Thank you so much for downloading my little labor of love! After searching for about a month I found no mods that were both 
compatible with OPM and added well made semi-accurate analogue of dwarf planets and/or asteroids from our solar system. So, about five months
ago from me typing this, I took it upon myself to write down a list of 9 objects that I wanted to see added to the stock+OPM system, and wrote
out some basic ideas for what those analogues might be like. They've changed quite a fair bit since their initial conception, but I am more than 
happy with the turn out! This would never have been possible without help and support from GregroxMun, Adstri, WarriorSabe, ElectricPants, SnailsAttack,
Zaffre, Gameslinx, Borv413, TheGhastModding and a fair few other members of the planet modding community. These fine folks did more than their fair share of help with helping 
me learn how to use Kopernicus, test the mod out, bugfix, and build me the courage to keep going!

I really do hope you enjoy these worlds as much as I have enjoyed crafting them, and look out for my projects to come! Once again, thank you for downloading MPE: The Minor Planets Expansion!

With much love,
 - Exo
